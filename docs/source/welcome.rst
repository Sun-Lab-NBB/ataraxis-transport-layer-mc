Welcome to ataraxis-transport-layer-mc API documentation page
=============================================================

ataraxis-transport-layer-mc is a C++ library for Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers that provides methods for
establishing and maintaining bidirectional communication with PC clients over USB or UART serial interfaces.

This library has a companion library written in Python
(`ataraxis-transport-layer-pc <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-transport-layer-pc>`_), intended for
host-computers participating in the serialized communication over the transport layer.

This library is part of the broader 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun Lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
