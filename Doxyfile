# This configuration file specifies how Doxygen should parse the docstrings inside the C++ source code files.
# It is used as part of the tox-automated project building workflow to generate API documentation for the library.
# Currently, this file provides the minimal configuration necessary to build the .xml documentation file that is then
# parsed and used by sphinx to render the static .html page via 'breathe' bridge.
